# Working Group Standards Glossary of Terms

The goal of this glossary of terms is to provide a repository of definitions of common terms in the layer 2 ecosystem, and that are used in this working groups standards. 

**Address Aliasing**

Refers to a method by which an address is associated with another (destination) address.

**Blockchain:**

An open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

**Bridge:**

Provides a connection that allows for the transfer of digital tokens or data between two different Layer 1, Layer 2 or Sidechain systems.

**Externally Owned Account**

An Ethereum address that is controlled by a cryptographic private key.

**Layer 1:**

A base blockchain network, such as Bitcoin, or Ethereum, and its underlying infrastructure that validates and finalizes transactions without the need of another blockchain network.

**Layer 2:**

A secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing Layer 1 system in such a way that it inherits the security properties of the Layer 1 system while allowing for a higher transaction throughput than the Layer 1 system.

**Layer 3:**

A tertiary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing Layer 2 system in such a way that it inherits the security properties of the Layer 2 system while allowing for an improvement of a Layer 2 characteristic such as higher transaction throughput than the Layer 2 system or transaction privacy.

**Sidechain:**

A secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg and using its own trust assumptions.

**Two-Way Peg:**

A mechanism by which tokens are transferred between a blockchain and a sidechain and back at a fixed or otherwise deterministic exchange rate.
